          <ul>
            <li>The treemap visualization shows the breakdown of the Biden Administration's tax overhaul plan for Jobs
              and
              Families in America level by level.</li>
            <li>The size of each rectangle represents the spendings in US-Dollars (e.g., the Housing rectangle,
              representing $213 billion, is approx. twice as large as the Clean drinking rectangle, representing $111
              billion.)</li>
            <li>The area covered by the whole treemap is subdivided recursively according to the amount of money they
              represent, level by level.</li>
            <li>On the top level, the area is split between American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan.</li>
            <li>Items within a sub-category are represented by rectangles that are closely packed together with
              increasingly larger gaps to the neighboring categories. For example, within the American Jobs Plan, the
              area
              is further subdivided into Community infrastructure, Workforce Development, Transportation, and Eldercare.
            </li>
            <li>Items on the bottom level that belong to the same sub-category are visually represented by using the
              same
              color.</li>
          </ul>

          <legend>Interacting with the chart</legend>
          <ul>
            <li>Hover over the rectangles (e.g., Housing) to get the dedicated value ($ 213 Billion) of the sub-category
              and further information.</li>
          </ul>
        </fieldset>

        <fieldset>
          <legend>Analyzing the chart</legend>
          <ul>
            <li>Seek out the largest rectangle of each group and look for significant differences within each colored
              group.</li>
            <li>Money spent on Community infrastructure is approx. equal to the money spent on Transportation, followed
              by R&D, Workforce, Manufacturing, and Eldercare.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, in Transportation, $174 Billion are spent on Electrifying vehicles.</li>
            <li>In the Families Plan, Expanded Tax Credit Extensions, $ 450 Billion is spent on Child Tax Credit
              expansions aiming to permanently make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable.</li>
            <li>In the Education category, Skilled healthcare workers are the sub-category with the least spent Billion
              dollars ($ 2 Billion) in comparison to the others.</li>
