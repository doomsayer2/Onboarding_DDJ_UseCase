            <li>The treemap visualization shows the breakdown of the <strong>Biden Administration's tax overhaul plan
                for Jobs and Families in America</strong> level by level.</li>
            <li>The size of each rectangle represents the <strong>spendings in US-Dollars</strong> (e.g., the
              <strong>Housing</strong> rectangle,
              representing <strong>$213 billion</strong>, is <strong>approx. twice as large</strong> as the
              <strong>Clean drinking</strong> rectangle, representing <strong>$111 billion</strong>.)</li>
            <>The area covered by the whole treemap is subdivided recursively according to the amount of money they
              represent, level by level. On the top level, the area is split between <strong>American Jobs Plan</strong> and <strong>American Families Plan</strong>.</li>
            <li>Items within a sub-category are represented by rectangles that are closely packed together with
              increasingly larger gaps to the neighboring categories. For example, within the <strong>American Jobs Plan</strong>, the
              area is further subdivided into <strong>Community infrastructure, Workforce Development, Transportation, and Eldercare</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>Items on the bottom level that belong to the same sub-category are visually represented by using the
              same
              color.</li>

            <li>Hover over the rectangles (e.g., <strong>Housing</strong>) to get the dedicated value (<strong>$ 213 Billion</strong>) of the sub-category

          <ul class="style_1">
            <li>Seek out the largest rectangular values (or the largest collected group of rectangles).</li>
            <li>Or seek out the smallest rectangular values (or the smallest collected group of rectangles).</li>
            <li>Money spent on <strong>Community infrastructure</strong> is approx. equal to the money spent on <strong>Transportation</strong>, followed
              by <strong>R&D, Workforce, Manufacturing, and Eldercare</strong>.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, in <strong>Transportation, $174 Billion</strong> are spent on Electrifying vehicles.</li>
            <li>In the <strong>Families Plan, Expanded Tax Credit Extensions, $ 450 Billion</strong> is spent on <strong>Child Tax Credit
              expansions</strong> aiming to permanently make the <strong>Child Tax Credit</strong> fully refundable.</li>
            <li>In the <strong>Education</strong> category, <strong>Skilled healthcare workers</strong> are the sub-category with the least spent Billion
              dollars ($ 2 Billion) in comparison to the others.</li>
