Sweden and Norway have relatively low top marginal tax rates imposed by their central federal governments, but have robust payroll taxes and municipal tax systems that create much higher effective tax rates. In countries where real estate gains are taxed differently than transfer of shares, the rate shown for capital gains represents the rate on transfer of shares (Japan, Poland and the United Kingdom). Countries in which there are more discrepancies in how types of gains are taxed are omitted from the capital gains chart (South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Portugal, the Netherlands and Turkey). In Canada and Australia, only 50% of capital gains are taxable at the corresponding personal income tax rate."}],"EndNotes":"\\n##### Edited by\\nChris Canipe, Heather Timmons and Lisa Shumaker\\n\\n##### Photos\\niStock"}')}}]);
