# Flourish Template
Based on the official template from [Flourish](https://github.com/kiln/flourish-sdk) in comibination with the custom self developed [visahoi](https://github.com/datavisyn/visAhoi) library the following templates have been created. They incoporate the method of Visualiaztion Onboarding and allow 
the useres of the template to define their own onboarding scenarios or adapt automatically generated ones. The templates work only for specific visualization types, which will be described for each teamplte individually.

<br/>
__Background:__<br/>
<br/>
_The authoring tool combines a Flourish template and the VisAhoi library. It provides a user interface to add onboarding and customize it:_
- editing, reordering, and/or removing the semi-automatically generated onboarding messages and onboarding stages, and
- adding own messages and stages.

_In general, the templates are divided into a fully customizable visualization area and the settings panel, which has limited customization possibilities._

The proof-of-concept implementation of a self-explanatory visualization onboarding approach for data-journalistic use cases. The interface is divided into two areas: (A) preview with the visualization (5), the onboarding button (6), and the settings panel, 
and (B) Flourish (1) with the settings regarding onboarding customizations (2, 3, 4). Also, journalists can change the data of the treemap (7) provided by the Flourish template.
